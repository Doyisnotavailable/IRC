Server
client
channel

First step will be
creating sockets and handling server signals 

Server will be containing all of the clients.

Server
• server port
• server socket fd
• a container for clients
• container for channels
• password




client would be containing all of the information about clients such as 
• nickname 
• username
• channels that the user is include
• client fd
• client ip address

channel
• channel name/id
• list of users in the channel
• list of operators in the channel

Socket - an endpoint that enables processes to communicate to each other. something like how pipes get i/o.

Ports - virtual places within an operating system where network connections start and end. They help computers sort the network traffic they receive.

• Ports starting from 0 to 1023 can or cannot be used. HTTP, FTP are inside this scope. Using this scope requires admin priv to use.
• 1024 to 49151 can be registered for specific purposes and are used by non-standard applications and services.
• 49152 to 65535 used by client applications for outgoing connections.
